# Time Series Prediction using RNN (LSTM) - README

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates how to use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells for time series forecasting. The goal is to predict future values in a time series based on past observations. This README will guide you through the flow of the notebook, detailing each step and the purpose behind it.

## Introduction
The notebook begins with an introduction to the problem of time series forecasting and sets the stage for applying LSTM RNNs, which are well-suited for sequence prediction tasks due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies in data.

## Dataset Preparation
The notebook starts by loading the dataset used for time series forecasting. The dataset consists of a univariate time series, which is prepared for training and testing the model. The data is loaded and divided into training and testing sets.

## Data Preprocessing
The data is then preprocessed to make it suitable for input into the LSTM network. This involves:

- **Normalizing the data** to ensure that it falls within a specific range (e.g., between 0 and 1).
- **Creating sequences of input data** and corresponding labels for training the model. This step typically involves windowing the time series data to create overlapping subsequences.

## Model Design
Next, the notebook defines the architecture of the LSTM-based RNN model. The model consists of the following layers:

- **LSTM Layer**: LSTM layer captures temporal dependencies, impact of past on present, in the sequence.
- **Dense Layer**: A fully connected layer to produce the final output from the LSTM's hidden state.

The model is compiled with an appropriate loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error) and an optimizer (e.g., Adam) to minimize the loss during training.

## Model Training
The notebook then trains the LSTM model on the prepared data. During training, the model learns to predict future values in the time series by minimizing the error between the predicted and actual values. Training parameters like batch size, number of epochs, and validation split are also set.

## Model Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated on the test dataset to measure its performance. This involves calculating metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) to quantify the accuracy of the model's predictions.

## Results Visualization
The notebook visualizes the results of the model's predictions by plotting:

- The actual time series data.
- The predicted values for the test set.
- A comparison between the actual and predicted future values to assess the model's performance.

## Findings
The notebook concludes with a discussion of the findings. It observes that the RNN was able to predict the overall trend of the time series, though it may have anticipated the trend occurring over a shorter period than it actually did.

## How to Use
1. **Setup**: Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`pytorch`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`).
2. **Load Data**: Replace the dataset loading section with your own data if necessary.
3. **Run Notebook**: Execute the notebook cells in order to train and evaluate the model on your time series data.

## Conclusion
This notebook provides a foundation for time series forecasting using LSTM RNNs. It can be extended or modified to suit more complex datasets or specific forecasting needs.
